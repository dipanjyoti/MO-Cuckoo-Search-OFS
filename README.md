# MO-Cuckoo-Search-OFS Multi-label data

The method is a cuckoo search based online feature selection for multi-label data.


# Motivation

Nowadays, many application domains especially social media networks, generate new features continuously at different time stamps. In such a scenario, when the features are arriving in an online fashion, to cope up with the continuous arrival of features, the selection task must also have to be a continuous process.  Moreover, in recent years, there are many application domains that generate data where samples may belong to more than one classes called multi-label dataset. The selection of online features for multi-label data have not been explored much in the literature. Moreover, the optimization of multiple objectives can help in selecting optimal feature set.

# SFS

The proposed method is a cuckoo search based multi-objective feature selection approach for multi-label data. It considers the fetures arriving individually as well as in the form of group.  The method also finds the co-relation amongst the class labels that helps to select the discriminative features across multiple labels.
